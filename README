Simple Twitter Streaming API client (http://apiwiki.twitter.com/Streaming-API-Documentation) implemented in Java. Uses growlnotify to show a Growl popup for new tweets/@replys. Will support following specific users and tracking keywords.

To use, fill in the necessary spots in config.properties (look at the comments in that file). then run:

  ./follow.sh

You can also override config settings from the command line:

  ./follow.sh -Dfollow.ids=7111912,619303,607
  
The only requirement is Maven (included with OS X)
